# Code of Conduct




## Welcome, Coders! 👋

Hey there! Welcome to the **Leetcode2k25** repository. Whether you’re here to contribute, learn, or just check out the solutions, we’re glad to have you! 🎉 This repo is all about improving together, so let’s keep things positive, helpful, and fun.

## Basic Guidelines ✨

Here’s what we expect from everyone contributing or participating:

1. **Respect each other**: Everyone's on their own learning path. Be supportive and encouraging, even if someone makes mistakes.
   
2. **Constructive feedback**: Give suggestions, not orders. We’re here to help, not judge! If you find something that can be improved, explain it kindly.
   
3. **Be open-minded**: There are multiple ways to solve problems. What works for you might not work for someone else, and that's okay. Let’s learn from each other’s approaches.

4. **Ask questions**: No question is a dumb question. If you’re confused about something, feel free to ask! We’re all here to help, and chances are, others are wondering the same thing.

5. **Collaborate**: The more we work together, the more we learn. Review other people's code, suggest improvements, and discuss solutions. This is how we grow. 🌱

## What We Don’t Want 🚫

Let’s avoid behaviors that bring negativity into the community:

- **Harsh criticism**: Pointing out mistakes is fine, but don’t make it personal or rude.
- **Trolling or spamming**: We're here to code, not to deal with distractions or irrelevant stuff. Keep things on topic.
- **Exclusionary behavior**: No discrimination of any kind—whether it’s based on skill level, gender, background, or anything else. We’re all equal here.

## Reporting Issues 🛑

If you see something that doesn’t vibe with this code of conduct (like offensive language or inappropriate behavior), feel free to let me know by opening an issue or dropping a private message. I’ll do my best to handle things fairly.

## Consequences 🤷‍♂️

Breaking the rules will get you a warning, and if it continues, I might need to remove your contributions or even block you from further participation. Let’s avoid that by being kind and respectful. 🙏

## Contributing Guidelines 🛠️

When contributing, follow these simple rules:
1. **Comment your code**: Make it easy for others to understand your thought process.
2. **Optimize where possible**: Contribute solutions that improve efficiency. It’s all about learning better ways to solve problems.
3. **Follow coding standards**: Keep the formatting clean and the code readable.

Feel free to work on any problem not already solved, or if you have a better solution to an existing one, go ahead and submit a pull request. Just make sure it’s thoroughly tested!

## Keep it Fun 🎮

This repository isn’t just about coding, it’s about growing as problem solvers and having fun while doing it. Let’s make it a positive experience for everyone involved. 

Thanks for contributing and being part of this learning journey. 🚀
